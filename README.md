C++ solutions for the Advent of Code programming puzzles - http://adventofcode.com/

The solutions were built on Windows with Visual Studio 2017. See the [project template and its documentation](Visual%20Studio%202017%20Project%20Template) for more information.

Some solutions use [boost](http://www.boost.org/). An easy way to install boost locally is with [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg):
1. `vcpkg install boost:x86-windows`
2. `vcpkg install boost:x64-windows`
