# advent-of-code-cpp
C++ solutions for the Advent of Code programming puzzles - http://adventofcode.com/

The solutions were built on Windows with Visual Studio 2017. See the [project template and its documentation](Visual%20Studio%202017%20Project%20Template) for more information.

Some solutions use one or more of the following libraries:  
- [boost](http://www.boost.org/)  
- [eigen3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)  

An easy way to install these locally is with [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg):  
`vcpkg install <library name>:<platform>`  
e.g., `vcpkg install boost:x86-windows` or `vcpkg install eigen3:x64-windows`
